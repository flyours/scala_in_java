  * Created by jeff on 18/04/2017.
  * F-bounded quantification or recursively bounded quantification, introduced in 1989,
  * allows for more precise typing of functions that are applied on recursive types.
  *
  * Often itâ€™s necessary to access a concrete subclass in a (generic) trait.
  * For example, imagine you had some trait that is generic,
  * but can be compared to a particular subclass of that trait.
